Life[n] is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent[v] . We would not dare[v] to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence[n] . If we could fly out of that window[n] hand in hand , hover[v] over this great city[n] , gently[a] remove the roofs[n] , and and peep in at the queer[a] things which are going on , the strange coincidences[n] , the plannings, the cross-purposes , the wonderful[a] chains of events , working[v] through generations , and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction[n] with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions[n] most stale and unprofitable.
